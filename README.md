Here's the markdown file with the corrected grammatical errors:

# Overview

GitFix is an AI-powered application that helps developers correct grammatical errors in markdown files within their GitHub repositories. It fetches files from a repository, processes them using AI models to generate corrected content, and then submits a pull request (PR) to the repository owner. It fixes 3 files per run, to avoid API abuse. Previously fixed files are stored at [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/pricing/redis), so when a repository is asked again, different 3 files are selected and processed.

## Tech Stack and Tools

- Next.js: Framework for building the frontend and backend.
- OpenAI: For natural language processing and grammar correction.
- GitHub API: For interacting with GitHub repositories and creating pull requests.
- QStash: For handling long-running operations.
- NextAuth: For authentication with GitHub.
  
### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- GitHub account
- GitHub personal access token
- GitHub OAuth application
- NextAuth secret

### Installation

1- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3 - Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

```env

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=

GITHUB_TOKEN=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= 
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=

UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=

QSTASH_URL=
QSTASH_TOKEN=

```

4 - Running the Application:

Start the development server.

```bash

npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:5000>.

**Important note:** In this project, hosting your application on a public server is strongly recommended. QStash requires a publicly accessible server, so using localhost directly won't work. You can use [Vercel Hobby Plan](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/hobby), it is perfectly fine for our purposes and doesn't require payment or entering billing information. You can modify the project according to your needs, however, we suggest you host them on a website.

## Backend Architecture

### 1- API Endpoints

#### auth

Handles GitHub authentication by using [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/). It manages the login process and redirects the user to the repository searching part.

#### gitfix

Handles the main functionality of fetching files from a repository and processing them. It streams updates to the frontend as the processing progresses.

Key Functions:

- GitHub Authentication: Checks if the user is authenticated, if not, it doesn't allow the user to perform any actions.
- File Fetching and Processing: Retrieves markdown files from the repository, extracts the text content, and submits files to the AI model by using Upstash QStash.
- Progress Streaming: Streams progress updates to the frontend.
  
#### status

Handles the updating and streaming of the current status of operations. It is responsible for receiving logs from the backend and sending them to the frontend.

### 2- GitHub Integration

The `github-api.ts` file handles the interactions with the GitHub API. Every GitHub operation is implemented in a separate function. Implemented operations are:

- Fetching markdown files
- Extracting text content
- Forking repository
- Committing and uploading an updated file
- Creating a branch
- Creating PR

Besides these functions, helper functions are also implemented to improve readability. We won't dive into details, but if you are curious about the implementation of those functions, you can examine the `github-api.ts` file.

### 3- QStash Functionality

QStash is used for handling long-running operations, particularly the AI model processing tasks. This ensures that the operations are handled asynchronously and do not exceed the execution limits of the deployment environment (We used the hobby plan of Vercel, so by using QStash, you don't need to pay for deployment). This part can be explained in 3 main steps:

- Task Submission: When a file is submitted for processing, a task is created and submitted to QStash.
- Callback Handling: Once the task is completed, QStash triggers a POST request to the callback endpoint in the backend, which was set when you submitted the task in the first step.
- Result Processing: The callback endpoint processes the results and handles the POST request.
